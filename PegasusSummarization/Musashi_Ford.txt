"Crossing at a ford" means, for example, crossing the sea at a strait, 
or crossing over a hundred miles of broad sea at a crossing place.
I believe this "crossing at a ford" occurs often in a man's lifetime.
It means setting sail even though you friends stay in harbour, 
knowing the route, knowing the soundness of your ship and the favour 
of the day. When all the conditions are meet, and there is perhaps a 
favourable wind, or a tailwind, then set sail. If the wind changes within a few miles of your destination, you must row across the remaining distance without sail. If you attain this spirit, it applies to everyday life. You must always think of crossing at a ford.
